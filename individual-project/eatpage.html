          <div class="card-body">Studies show that animals are a huge producer of the world's carbon monoxide level. Cows produce almost double the amount of carbon monoxide as cars. It is a common misconception that protein only comes from animal products. Try limiting your meat intake by a few days a week, and substitute it for plant-based protein sources such as beans, quinoa, or tofu. <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sustainable-agriculture/eco-farming/eat-more-plants/">Check out this article if you're not convinced.</a>

          <div class="card-body">By incorporating more vegetables into your diet, you are filling your caloric needs with more nutrient dense foods. Vegetables are full of fiber and other nutrients that your body needs to function. By eating more vegetables, you are lessening your need for other food groups. Maybe try replacing a starch as your side for dinner with a salad.</div>

          <div class="card-body">A big problem today is waste. People are constantly preparing or buying more food than they will actually eat. By having more food than you need, you are creating a higher demand. By preparing smaller portions of food, you are decreasing the chances of wasting food. Try making smaller portions of food for yourself, and grabbing a small snack afterwards if you are still hungry.</div>

Look out for words like, "organic" or "grass-fed".</div>
