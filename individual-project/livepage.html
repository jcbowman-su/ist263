    <h1>How to Live Sustainably</h1>

    <h2>Tip #1: Buy Less Waste</h2>
    <p>Shopping waste-free can be challenging, but more waste-free grocery stores are popping up everywhere.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqabrJ8fY9E">Check out this video about Lauren Singer's Package Free Shop. If you don't live near a shop like this, try bringing your own reusable containers to wholesale stores to eliminate packaging. You can also purchase reusable shopping bags.</a> </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: right;">Tip #2: Try Alternative Transportation Methods</h2>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Take a walk or bike to work. If it's too far or the weather is not in your favor, try public transportation like buses or subways. This can dramatically reduce your carbon footprint. If your commute is too long and these methods aren't working for you, ask a friend near you to start carpooling.</p>

    <h2>Tip #3: Recycle</h2>
    <p>Try being more conscious about what you put in the trash. Just going online and checking out what types of waste can be recycled in your area can make a huge difference.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: right;">Tip #4: Shop Sustainably</h2>
    <img src="clothes.jpg" alt="Clothes on a Rack" style="width: 25%; float: right;">
    <p style="text-align: right;">Something that a lot of people don't realize is that clothes can create waste too. When cleaning out your closet, go through and decide what can be donated or resold rather than throwing them out or letting them collect dust in your closet. Additionally, try looking for clothes at thrift stores oe second hand markets. They even make them online now.</p>
